In class exercises:
1. Write a program that displays the phrase "Hello, World!" to the user.

2. Write a program that computes the sum of 5 + 10 and displays the result to the user.

3. Write a program that prompts the user to enter his or her name and then responds with "Hello, <insert name here>." For example, if the user entered "James" as his name, the program
will display the phrase "Hello, James."

4. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number and then displays the number multiplied by itself. For example, if the user inputs "3" the program displays "9" (which is 3 x 3). (Hint: use the Number() function to convert the string value returned by prompt into a number value). 

5. Write a program that prompts the user to enter two numbers and then displays the sum of those two numbers. (Hint: use two separate prompt() calls to get the two numbers).

6. Write a program that displays the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to the user via consecutive alert boxes. (The first alert box shows "1", after clicking okay, the second alert box shows "2", etc.)

7. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number. If the number is evenly divisible by two, the program will display the text "Your number is evenly divisible by two!" If the the number is not evenly divisible by two, nothing is displayed.

8. Write a program that computes 11! and displays the result to the user. (Hint: 11! means "11 factorial"--google "factorial" if you are unfamiliar with this term.

9. Write a program that prompts the user to input three adjectives describing themselves and then displays a string to the user that uses all three adjectives. For example if the user enters "smart," "handsome," and "rich", the program could display "You are a smart, handsome, and rich person."

10. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature in fahrenheit and the displays that temperature converted to celcius.
